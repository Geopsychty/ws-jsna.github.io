<p>Period expectation of life at a given age for an area, in a given time period, is an estimate of the average number of years a person of that age would survive if they experienced the particular area’s age specific mortality rates for that period throughout the rest of their life (ONS, 2015). The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than the mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a person in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates are likely to change in the future and because many of those within the area may live elsewhere for at least part of their lives.</p>

<p>Period life expectancy at birth is not a guide to the remaining expectation of life at any given age. For example, if female life expectancy at birth was 80 years for a particular area, the life expectancy of women aged 65 years in that area is likely to exceed 15 years. This reflects the fact survival from a particular age depends only on the death rates beyond that age, whereas survival from birth is based on death rates at every age.</p>

<p>At county level, for 2012-2014, life expectancy for men and women in West Sussex is good and has remained consistently (and significantly) above that of England, although remains in line with the SE region. Life expectancy at 65 years is also higher compared to England the SE region.</p>

<p>At District and Borough level ‐ for males LE ranges from 79.2 years (Worthing) to 81.4 years (Horsham and Mid Sussex); for women again Worthing has the lowest life expectancy 83.2 years, with the highest in Chichester and Mid Sussex (85.0 years). <a href="http://jsna.westsussex.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/West-Sussex-LAs-Life-Expectancy.xlsx">Click here to download life expectancy tables for West Sussex districts.</a></p>

<p>The maps below show Life Expectancy at birth for Females and Males respectively for small areas (Middle-layer Super Output Areas). These estimates collate data over five years (2009-2013) due to the small number of deaths in each small area.</p>

<p>This briefing outlines the life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years for West Sussex Males and Females as well as estimates for smaller areas.</p>

<p>At county level, life expectancy for men and women in West Sussex is good and has remained consistently (and significantly) above that of England, although remains in line with the SE region.</p>

<p>Life expectancy at 65 years is also higher compared to England the SE region.</p>

<p>At District and Borough level ‐ for males LE ranges from 79.2 years (Worthing) to 81.4 years (Horsham and Mid Sussex); for women again Worthing has the lowest life expectancy 83.2 years, with the highest in Chichester and Mid Sussex (85.0 years).</p>

<p>Evidence indicates that inequality has been rising and that older person poverty is highly associated with decreases in life expectancy values.</p>

<p>Number of years a person can expect to live without developing a long term limiting illness by electoral ward based on data from the 2001 Census.</p>

<p>These data have been downloaded from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) rather than locally calculated. It is based on a combination of life expectancy by ward calculations for the period 1999-2003 inclusive and self reported assessments of limiting long term illness from the census (not medical diagnosis).</p>

<p>Further notes on the methodology are included within the document.</p>

<p>Disability free life expectancy is very strongly correlated with deprivation and varies even more than life expectancy.</p>

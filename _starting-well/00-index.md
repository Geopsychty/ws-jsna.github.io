The health and wellbeing of children from conception to the age of two is a priority of the West Sussex Health and Wellbeing Board and the future West Sussex Plan.

From 1 October 2015, the responsibility for commissioning some public health services for 0-5 year olds transferred from NHS England to local authorities, particularly the Healthy Child Programme, which includes health visiting and the Family Nurse Partnership programme.

This section of the website provides key data and analyses relating to these young populations as well as school age children and young people in West Sussex to enable planning and support to ensure West Sussex populations are starting and developing well.

Data in this section are provided under five headings:
* [Maternity and fertility](/maternity-and-fertility/)
* [Birth and the newborn](/birth-and-the-newborn/)
* [Early years](/early-years/)
* [School age children and education](/education-children/)
* [Young people](/young-people/)
